********* Advanced Thread Group Methods by using Jmeter plugins ***********

To Manage Jmeter plugin from the Jmeter tool, have ti install the "Plugins Manager" first.
Plugin Manager "JAR file" download link: https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/PluginsManager/

-> Download the Plugins Manager JAR file and put it into JMeter's lib/ext directory. 
-> Then start JMeter and go to "Options" menu to access the Plugins Manager.
-> Go to "Available Plugins"	--> Select "Custom Thread Groups" 	--> Apply changes and Restart JMeter
