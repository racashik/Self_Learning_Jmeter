********* Use Http Cookie Manager to capture sessions ***********

In general, after running the Jmeter test, we can't be confirm by seen the "Green icon" that the test are passed.
We can get confirm after checking the request send and receive response body text.

Jmeter do not save Cookies with the request as the Browser does so we need to add "HTTP cookie Manager"

********* Way to add Cookie Manager **********
First will record a browser test by "BlazeMeter extension" on the following link.
Start recording by loding the url on a new tab. (Open a browser new tab, start recording then paste the Url and perform)

-> Download the save project and Inport to the Jmeter.
-> Add a listener "View Results Tree" to check the result.
-> Add "HTTP Cookie Manager"  (Add -> Congif Element -> HTTP Cookie Manager)
-> Run and see the result in the Listener's response body.


To check the difference, how cookie manager works and whats happen if do not save session cookies.
First Run the test first without the "HTTP Cookie Manager" and then add it and run again.
Now check the difference in the response body.
