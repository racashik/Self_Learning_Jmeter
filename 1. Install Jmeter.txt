Download the Jmeter "Zip" file.
Unzip the file and open it.
Go to the "Bin" folder and open the "ApacheJMeter.jar" file.

It do not need to install like the other software. Everytime open Jmeter by clicking "ApacheJMeter.jar"

N.B: Do not delete the "Apache Jemeter" file cause whole file need everytime to open it.


N.B: We can only make & run 1 project on "Jmeter" at a time, so if need to make another project, have to 
clear the existing one and make the new one.
